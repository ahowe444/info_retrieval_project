# info_retrieval_project
A web app and visualization tool for Twitch followers. 

# Instructions
My Google Colab notebook `crawler.ipynb` can be viewed here, but should be cloned and then uploaded to
Google Colab for interacting with it.  <br><br><br>

My web app is Flask App. First install: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/ <br>
Then running these commands
```
$ export FLASK_APP=server.py
$ flask run
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
   
 from this link https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/ should get the web app working. 
 Once you run `flask run` there may additional Python packages to install which (after activating the 
 virtual environment) can be installed with `pip install <package>`.
